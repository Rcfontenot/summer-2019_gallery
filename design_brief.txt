For my gallery I will be using teal, yellow and ghostwhite for my color scheme as well as a shaded tree enclosing for my background.I will have four web pages; A home page, shoe gallery, a bike gallery and a car gallery.

The site I like the most for a gallery is google images. For one it has just about every image of everything you can think of and you can also go to the website where the image is being hosted. The other gallery site I like is pexels. It's a great place to find free stock images laid out in a user friendly way.
